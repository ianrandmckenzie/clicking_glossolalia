# Click Sound Rippler

This is part of an project for supplementing my drawings with a more interactive experience. The basic premise is that there are 4 layers. The layers start on the inside and work their way outward. If there are multiple sounds in a layer, they happen simultaneously â€“ something most humans are not capable of, creating somewhat of an alien cacophony.

## The Grid

In a 2-layer system, the number 5 is "layer 0." 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 are "layer 1."

## How sounds are produced

### Layer 0: The "Droplet"

Position: Absolute Center

To produce this noise with your mouth may take some practice. There are two simultaneous movements happening with your mouth:
1. Positioning your lips to make an "oooh" sound, without making the "oooh" sound. During your click, you expand your lips to make the "ahhh" sound - again, without actually making the sound. In a sensem you are going, "oooowah!" in silence.
2. Make a tongue clicking noise by pressing the tip of your tongue to the top of your mouth. Create a seal so that you are attempting to suck in air, but instead there is now pressure on your tongue because of the seal. Use the muscle of your tongue to release the pressure and produce the clicking noise.
3. Combining these two motions should produce a "droplet" sounding noise if done correctly.

### Layer 1

#### Number 1, "oooh" click (top left)

Make a tongue clicking noise by pressing the tip of your tongue to the top of your mouth. Create a seal so that you are attempting to suck in air, but instead there is now pressure on your tongue because of the seal. Use the muscle of your tongue to release the pressure and produce the clicking noise. While doing this, your lips should be positioned as if you are making an "oooh" noise.

#### Number 8, "ahh" click (bottom right)

Make a tongue clicking noise by pressing the tip of your tongue to the top of your mouth. Create a seal so that you are attempting to suck in air, but instead there is now pressure on your tongue because of the seal. Use the muscle of your tongue to release the pressure and produce the clicking noise. While doing this, your lips should be positioned as if you are making an "ahhh" noise.
